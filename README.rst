Parameter Space Mapping
=======================

SPACEMAP is a framework for photonic device design based on dimensionality reduction. It exploits local adjoint optimization through an interface with the package `lumopt <https://github.com/chriskeraly/lumopt>`_ from Lumerical.

Features
--------
- Mapping of multi-parameter design spaces
- Straightforward multi-objective optimization
- No need for a careful choice of the initial guess for the parameter set
